McNally is the chief designer of the space while Starr and team focus on culinary and operations. Pastis features elements similar to the original such as the restaurant\u2019s classic curved zinc bar outfitted with signature subway tiles, vintage mirrors with handwritten daily specials, and a mosaic-tiled floor. Guests can expect to find the classic bistro fare Pastis is known for, with a menu that offers breakfast, weekend brunch, lunch and dinner.",

The Tavern was named after the Minetta Brook, which ran southwest from 23rd Street to the Hudson River. Over the course of its long history, the Tavern was frequented by various layabouts and hangers-on including Ernest Hemingway, Ezra Pound, Eugene O'Neill, E. E. Cummings, Dylan Thomas, and Joe Gould, as well as by various writers, poets, and pugilists. Since its renovation, Minetta Tavern has best been described as \"Parisian steakhouse meets classic New York City tavern.\" We hope \u2014 and believe \u2014 that's a somewhat accurate description of the place.",

(Please please be on time)\nNew Yorkers who enjoy being in the know frequent restaurants like Shinzo. This 9-seater establishment, which is something of a hidden treasure, offers excellent omakase in a casual environment. Fresh fish is served here, sorted straight from Japan, and professionally prepared by a group of chefs that have experience from some of the best sushi restaurants in the area. We don't have a set menu; instead, we alter it daily based on the freshest ingredients available.\n\nGiven that we do not currently have a beer and wine license, BYOB is permitted without incurring any additional fees. We do offer typical beverages like Perrier and other flavored sparkling waters, Japanese Rice Green Tea, Japanese Oolong Tea, and so forth. (NOTE: For BYOB, please just bring one bottle of alcohol per person; no tequilas, XO, or other beverages over 30% alcohol content.) (ONLY the 9:00 PM section can stay until 10:30PM since it's the last section. (1.5 Hour)",

If you want to order more food, we have a \"A La Carte\" option. You may double your course by letting us know you want to double the course in advance which is in the beginning of the session as we only have 60 min to work with before the next session comes in. We have 9 seats at the sushi bar. Sushi bar seating is available for 60 minutes. The time allotted for holding seats will be just 20 minutes. If you are going to be late for more than 20 minutes, we can shift you to a different date so you won't get charged with cancellation. Email us at shinzoomakase@gmail.com if you have any questions, and we'll respond to you within 24 Hours. Please call 917-938-0482 if you need assistance right away (For phone and text, we will only respond during office hours which is from 5:00pm - 10:00pm). We do offer the following option, kosher, no shellfish, pescetarian, gluten free option. We do not offer vegan options but there is a vegan omakase known as Omakaseed.\n\nIf you need to cancel your reservation, please do so before the 24 hours of your reservation. Any cancellation within 24 hours will result in a charge of $69.00 per person. If you do not show up for your reservation, you will be placed in \"No Show\" status after the 30 minute mark of your booking, which will result in a $69.00 fee per person. In the event of an emergency, please contact the restaurant. We can rebook you on another date or give you credit for your future visit. (Of course, if you could, please arrive on time because we cut the exact number of fish every day based on the headcount of reservations for that day, so any leftovers will be disposed of, resulting in a financial loss for our business.) We do not offer vegan options, please do reach our guideline before making a booking.\n\nWe are located at 89 E 2nd Street, New York, NY 10009, in Manhattan's East Village.

(Please please be on time)\nNew Yorkers who enjoy being in the know frequent restaurants like Shinzo. This 9-seater establishment, which is something of a hidden treasure, offers excellent omakase in a casual environment. Fresh fish is served here, sorted straight from Japan, and professionally prepared by a group of chefs that have experience from some of the best sushi restaurants in the area. We don't have a set menu; instead, we alter it daily based on the freshest ingredients available.\n\nGiven that we do not currently have a beer and wine license, BYOB is permitted without incurring any additional fees. We do offer typical beverages like Perrier and other flavored sparkling waters, Japanese Rice Green Tea, Japanese Oolong Tea, and so forth. (NOTE: For BYOB, please just bring one bottle of alcohol per person; no tequilas, XO, or other beverages over 30% alcohol content.) (ONLY the 9:00 PM section can stay until 10:30PM since it's the last section. (1.5 Hour)",

If you want to order more food, we have a \"A La Carte\" option. You may double your course by letting us know you want to double the course in advance which is in the beginning of the session as we only have 60 min to work with before the next session comes in. We have 9 seats at the sushi bar. Sushi bar seating is available for 60 minutes. The time allotted for holding seats will be just 20 minutes. If you are going to be late for more than 20 minutes, we can shift you to a different date so you won't get charged with cancellation. Email us at shinzoomakase@gmail.com if you have any questions, and we'll respond to you within 24 Hours. Please call 917-938-0482 if you need assistance right away (For phone and text, we will only respond during office hours which is from 5:00pm - 10:00pm). We do offer the following option, kosher, no shellfish, pescetarian, gluten free option. We do not offer vegan options but there is a vegan omakase known as Omakaseed.\n\nIf you need to cancel your reservation, please do so before the 24 hours of your reservation. Any cancellation within 24 hours will result in a charge of $69.00 per person. If you do not show up for your reservation, you will be placed in \"No Show\" status after the 30 minute mark of your booking, which will result in a $69.00 fee per person. In the event of an emergency, please contact the restaurant. We can rebook you on another date or give you credit for your future visit. (Of course, if you could, please arrive on time because we cut the exact number of fish every day based on the headcount of reservations for that day, so any leftovers will be disposed of, resulting in a financial loss for our business.) We do not offer vegan options, please do reach our guideline before making a booking.\n\nWe are located at 89 E 2nd Street, New York, NY 10009, in Manhattan's East Village. Our Store Closed to 1st Avenue (Cross Street Between 1st Avenue & Avenue A). The small, white storefront. (Customer can get to us through M15, F Trains which all within 1-2 min of walking distance)",

KONO's discreet locale within Chinatown's Canal Arcade echoes the hidden streets and alleyways of Tokyo \u2013 inside, guests will be treated to a special evening of smoke and fire as they watch chef Kono prepare a multi-course, kappo-style yakitori omakase rooted in tradition and seasonality. Guests can expect to enjoy various cuts (and specialty cuts) of organic Amish chicken.\n\nAbout Our Chef\nChef Kono grew up in Saitama, Japan, where he worked as a cook in his family\u2019s restaurant and fish store. Upon graduating from the Musashino Culinary School of Japan, Kono made his way through several fine dining establishments (most notably, Kyoryori Suzuyoshi, renowned for its traditional Kyoto-style cuisine). In 2006, Kono immigrated to the United States to work at Yakitori Torishin in New York City. During his tenure as Executive Chef and Manager, the restaurant earned and maintained a coveted Michelin star and a three-star review from The New York Times. Most recently, Kono helmed the Chikarashi Isso yakitori pop-up at Hotel 50 Bowery, which operated from October 2020 to July 2021.\n",

AJ opened Rubirosa to create an institution of his own In Manhattan.  AJ was inspired by the family's 60+ year signature pizza recipe to create our pizzas served at Rubirosa.  \n\nIn addition to our famous pizza, we proudly offer Italian-American classics featuring a wide array of pastas made fresh in-house daily.\n\nRubirosa is located in the heart of Nolita and its clientele bridges the gap between the old and new neighborhood regulars. \n\nRubirosa's homey and comfortable atmosphere welcomes every occasion, from family-style group dining to an aperitivo and antipasti at our cozy bar.\n",

The booths were already in place and they kept the chairs until they fell apart or were destroyed in the brawls that marked the early years. They were so poor they threw nothing out, not even the salt. Guy turned his Alsatian cooking skills to fine steaks and fish for low prices - even cheaper at the bar.\n\nSerge stood outside on Prince Street, a lonely figure importuning passersby to enter and taste. People began to trickle in from their illegal lofts in the neighborhood. Some came back the next night or the next week, and people spread the word. More came, and came back. Soon the locals were complaining about the good reviews. The rest is New York bistro history.",

As you taste the dishes on the menu, you can almost feel the moment you arrive in Chinatown, or traverse the lower east side, cross Mulberry Street and smell the Zeppoli during the Feast of San Gennaro. A New Yorker both by upbringing and in his soul, this is his love letter to the city with the panache of his classic French culinary training, and the passion of his Italian American heritage. Torrisi Bar and Restaurant features a walk-in only bar room in order to \u201cmake space\u201d for everyone.   ",
